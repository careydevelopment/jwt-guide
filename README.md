# request-parameter-guide
This repository includes a fully deployable Spring Boot app that demonstrates the use of the @RequestParam annotation.

If you're interested in learning more about how this app works, feel free to check out <a href="https://careydevelopment.us/blog/spring-boot-how-to-handle-request-parameters-in-web-apps" target="_blank">the tutorial.</a>

You can run the Spring Boot app by right-clicking on the RequestParameterGuide class and selecting Run As... and Java Application.

Here's a sample URL that accesses the app from a browser:

http://localhost:8080/contact?id=1
